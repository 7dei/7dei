🚀 Hey there! I'm Die. 👋
Aspiring Full Stack Engineer | Systems Engineering Student from Argentina 🇦🇷

I'm a determined Systems Engineering student and developer focused on building robust, modern applications. I've always found joy in creation, from coding mods as a kid to engineering scalable software today.
I build any project that comes to mind, focusing on utility and learning, but also having fun. My favorite technologies right now are TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind. I also code sometimes with Python or Java, both languages that I genuinely enjoy.

🎮 My Journey
I started coding early—at the age of 10—building mods and plugins for Minecraft servers just for fun. After a professional hiatus competing in Fortnite at an elite level, I returned to programming two years ago. 
That competitive drive now fuels my constant learning and project development. I treat coding as a passion and a challenging hobby, striving constantly to get better.

🎧 Interests
Music is my constant companion; I listen to any genre at any time of the day. I'm usually listening to: Kanye West, Frank Ocean, David Bowie, Clairo, Radiohead, The Cure, The Strokes, and Blur, who are among my favorite artists and bands. 
(I also enjoy training, playing video games, and reading!)

🌱 I’m currently learning:
Deep diving into JavaScript fundamentals to achieve an expert-level understanding (focusing on advanced concepts to master React and TypeScript).

🔭 I’m currently working on:
A Smart Inventory/Stock Management System. A full-stack application designed for data integrity and business efficiency.

Stack: TS/React/Tailwind (Front) | Python/FastAPI/PostgreSQL (Back).
Deployment Goal: Implementing Docker and AWS S3 for production-ready deployment.
